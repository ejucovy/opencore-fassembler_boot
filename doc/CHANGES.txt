Renamed ``rebuild-opencore`` -> ``rebuild-opencore-site``

Added ``new-opencore-site-config`` command that simply prints the config 
template to stdout (useful for existing deployment structures)

Passing profile_url as a positional arg was broken.  It works now.

New package opencore-fassembler_boot, based on OpenplansBoot.
