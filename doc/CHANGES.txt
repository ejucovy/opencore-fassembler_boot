0.5
---

Add an optional parameter num_extra_zopes which, if set, will
cause N extra zope instances to be installed at the end of the build.

Requires fassembler>=0.5 (0.4 which added the ``extrazope`` project
and 0.5 which added the ``num_extra_zopes`` setting); opencore-fassembler_projects>=0.3 which now respects the ``num_extra_zopes`` setting when building the frontend; and libopencore>=0.4 which allows load-balanced proxying to a set of zope servers.

0.4.1
-----

Fixed typo in in-process docs.

0.4
---

Removed fassembler_projects parameter. Instead, the bootstrap script now looks for
a file "fassembler-req.txt" in the profile directory to be built, since profiles
should manage their own requirements.

0.3.2
-----

Renamed ``rebuild-opencore`` -> ``rebuild-opencore-site``

Added ``new-opencore-site-config`` command that simply prints the config 
template to stdout (useful for existing deployment structures) 

0.3.1
-----

Passing profile_url as a positional arg was broken.  It works now.

0.3
---

New package opencore-fassembler_boot, based on OpenplansBoot.

Redesigned to use configuration files managed per-site, and to make the newbuild.sh script non-public.

0.2
---

- Remove --use-plone3 as an option; obsoleted by default-build.ini
